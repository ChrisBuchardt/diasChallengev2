# DIASCodingChallenge
DIAS REST Api challenge written in Java

Challenge One Patient
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A hospital needs a new medical journal system to manage doctor-patient relations. They would like to prohibit doctors in one department from access the medical journal of a patient admitted to another department.

Create a REST web service in a language of your choice. We prefer Node.js, Python, Java or Go using a framework. The service should be runnable with Docker.


The API should have three concepts: admission, medical journal(patient) and doctor. â€‹
An admission has at least the following attributes:
	Department
	Zero or more doctors
	One medical journal

A medical journal (patient) has the following attributes:
	Name
	Social Security Number

An doctor has the following attributes:
	Name
	id
	Department

The API should support:
	Check if doctor X has access to patient Y medical journal
The API may support:
	Create new doctor
	Create new patient
	Get a list of all patients for a doctor
	Get a list of all doctors for a patient
	Assign a doctor to a patient

You don't need to consider authentication of a doctor. For the sake of this implementation, we can assume the identity of a doctor with a doctor query parameter

  

localhost:8080/getPatient?patientID=<CPR>&doctorID=<DOCTOR_WITH_ACCESS>

localhost:8080/getPatient?patientID=<CPR>&doctorID=<DOCTOR_WITHOUT_ACCESS>
  

A patient can't exist without a medical journal

It should not be possible for a doctor to see a medical journal from a patient that is not his and currently not in his department.

This challenge "solution" was written in python utilising flask for the web api, it is by no means finished as after 4 hours I ran into issues and decided to end it there. 
However the structure of and future plans are documented in the files. 
Beer in mind that it currently does not compile.
